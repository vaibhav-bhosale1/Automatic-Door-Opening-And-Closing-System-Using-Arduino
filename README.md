# Automatic-Door-Opening-And-Closing-System-Using-Arduino
The Automatic Door Opener System, employing a PIR or IR Sensor with Arduino, detects individuals in close proximity and automatically opens/closes doors, a technology commonly seen in malls and hospitals. These systems slide doors open upon approach (within 2-3 feet) and close after a brief delay (5-10 seconds) unless continuous movement is detected. Offering convenience and noise reduction, they eliminate the need for manual door operation and the role of a doorman. Arduino-based Automated Door Opener projects provide practical insights into automatic door mechanisms, applicable in various settings like garages, toilets, and offices.

working of circuit:
The circuit operates in two ways, utilizing either a PIR sensor or an IR sensor for object detection. The primary difference lies in their detection methodsâ€”IR relies on wave reception, while PIR detects energy level differences. The circuit, demonstrated with an IR sensor, connects the sensor to the ground, 5V Vcc, and a digital pin. A servo motor, linked to ground, Vcc, and another digital pin (9), controls a cardboard piece mimicking a door. Optional elements like LED or LCD modules can indicate object detection. The Arduino code adjusts the servo angle based on sensor output, simulating door movement. A delay ensures the door remains open if further movement is detected within a specified timeframe.
